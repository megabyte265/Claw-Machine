# Program description:
#   joystick.py is a basic program meant to interact with a basic HID joystick device. It reads the values of the
#   joystick's axes and represents them on a display screen. This program was written for use with a
#   Microsoft Sidewinder joystick (its really old, not even supported anymore, but still a basic HID). Use with other
#   joysticks may require adjusting the index value of x and y axes in the program code.
#
# As of last edit:
#   New function writeArduino() opens serial connection to Arduino, writes joystick data, and closes serial connection.
#   Both strings sent to arduino consist of integer values. One is of the axes, this needs to be divided by 1000 in the
#   arduino code. One is the button values, 0s and 1s, to control future subfunctions
